export const ABOUT_TITLE = 'About';
export const ABOUT_CONTENT = `I am a skilled full stack developer with over a year of commercial experience. I have a strong expertise in React and Redux, as well as proficiency in TypeScript. I have recently expanded my skillset to include backend development with Node.js, Express, Nest.js, and have a solid understanding of Next.js and popular front-end frameworks such as Tailwind and Bootstrap.

I approach software development with an entrepreneurial mindset, always looking for ways to innovate and bring value to my projects. Communication is a key aspect of my work and I excel at it, using various methods such as screen casts, video calls, and written communication to build trust and transparency with my team.

With extensive knowledge of JavaScript, I have a proven track record of delivering high-quality applications with React and Firebase, but I am also well-versed in other technologies including Node & Express, MongoDB,  REST API.
In addition to my technical skills, I am also an experienced user interface and user experience designer, utilizing Figma to create low and high-fidelity mockups, design systems, and prototypes. I am dedicated to delivering intuitive and visually appealing user experiences that meet the needs of my clients.`;
